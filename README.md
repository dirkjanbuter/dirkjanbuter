# Hello & welcome to my Github-com page

I am working on Dirk Jan Buter's Magazine and it provides information on technology for personal development, such as artificial intelligence, biohacking, cryonics, virtual reality and quantified self. At the same time, I organize events to meet like-minded people, focusing on presentations, networking time and fun activities. The magazine aims to share and inspire information and shows that technology can make a positive contribution to the world.
