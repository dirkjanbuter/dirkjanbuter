# Hello & welcome to my Github-com page

I'm working on Dirk Jan Buter's Magazine and it provides information about technology for personal development, such as artificial intelligence, biohacking, cryonics, virtual reality and quantified self. At the same time, I organize events to meet like-minded people, with an emphasis on presentations, networking moments and fun activities. The magazine aims to share and inspire information and shows that technology can make a positive contribution to the world.
